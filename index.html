  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Iâ€™m a researcher turned designer who loves geeking out about great design, good coffee, and fashion. Currently, I am a Freelance Graphic Designer, but am in the process of transitioning to a career in front-end web development.</p>
  <p>Whether it's a piece of jewelry or a company's new website, I enjoy the process of building and creating things. Specifically, I love collaborating with people to develop elegant solutions and making products that the world can use and interact with.</p>

  <h2>Where I'm from</h2>
  <p>I am originally from Seattle, WA, but have been living in Boston, MA for the past 10 years. My undergraduate studies at Boston University brought me to the East Coast, but I ended up staying after graduation, because I love the city so much.</p>

  <h2>More about me</h2>
  <h3>What are your favorite hobbies?</h3>
  <p>I love to travel, watch old Steve Martin movies, swim, hike, go to the beach, and spend time with family. 
  <h3>What is your dream job?</h3>
  <p>I would love to work as a front-end web developer for a fashion company. With e-commerce making up such a large percentage of today's sales, it would be an exciting challenge to create a site that's just as compelling and communicative as a well-curated brick and mortar experience.</p>
  <h3>What shows have you been watching lately?</h3>
  <p>Currently, my favorite show is "Walking Dead, but " I am also a big fan of "Ugly Betty," "Workaholics," and "Naked and Afraid."</p>
  <h3>What music have you been listening to lately?</h3>
  <p>I love all types of music, but have recently had the following on replay: Ed Sheeran, Lauryn Hill, Outkast, and Elton John.</p>
  <h3>What's your favorite way to unwind after a long day of coding?</h3>
  <p>A big cold mug of cherry lambic, my favorite beer, complete with a heaping scoop of vanilla gelato!</p>
